<p class="heading" id="material">Midterm Exam Material</h2>

<p class="text">
  The exam may include anything we covered in assigned lecture videos
  or in lab up to and including <strong>Sorting</strong>.
  The lecture videos often correspond to (supplementary) readings from
  <em>Java Structures</em> (Chapters 1-7 and Chapter 9).
  You may wish to review some of these chapters if there are concepts that were unclear
  or where you would like to practice.
  However, <b>we will not</b> be including any questions on material
  that was not discussed in the assigned lecture videos, conferences, or labs.
</p>

<p class="subheading" id="topics">Key Course Topics</p>

<p class="text">
  The following <em>non-exhaustive</em> list may be helpful to recall
  some of the key topics we have covered:
</p>

<ul class="bullet">
  <li>
    Java syntax, compilation, and debugging, as covered in our programming assignments
  </li>

  <li>
    Classes (both concrete and abstract), interfaces,
    and the roles that concrete classes, abstract classes, and interfaces play in
    program design
  </li>

  <li>
    Information hiding (abstraction as a concept):
    <ul>
      <li>Why it is good</li>
      <li>familiarity with the Java language features that support these ideas</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    Extending classes with inheritance
  </li>
  <li>
    Generic classes
    (e.g., <code>Vector&lt;E&gt;</code>, <code>Association&lt;K,V&gt;</code>,
    <code>SinglyLinkedList&lt;E&gt;</code>, etc.) and their use
  </li>

  <li>
    Pre-conditions, post-conditions, and assertions
  </li>
  <li>
    The meaning of <code>static</code> (and non-static) as applied to
    variables and methods
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>Vector</code>, its implementation in the <code>structure5</code> package,
    and its methods
  </li>

  <li>Complexity: <em>Big O</em> definition:
    <ul>
      <li>Determining the asymptotic behavior of mathematical functions</li>
      <li>Determining the time and space complexity for a given
algorithm/piece of code.</li>
      <li>Worst and best case analysis (and why they might differ).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>Linked lists (Singly, Doubly, and Circularly linked lists):
    <ul>
      <li>
	<em>Note</em> In the Linked List lab,
	we modified the standard doubly linked list implementation
	by adding ``dummy nodes’’.
	You also should be familiar with the standard implementation as described in
	class and in the textbook (i.e., lists without dummy nodes).
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    Recursion and induction
  </li>

  <li>Sorting:
    <ul>
      <li>
	A working understanding of the Bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort,
	merge sort, and quicksort algorithms
      </li>
      <li>
	The benefits/trade-offs of using <code>Comparator</code> classes and the
	<code>Comparable</code> interface
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

</ul>

  Some Strategies for Studying
</p>
<p class="text">
  There are many ways to approach studying, and ultimately, there is
  no one strategy that works "best" for everyone. Our hope is that
  you will use this page to decide the best way for <em>you</em> to
  prepare. Below we have listed some resources that are available to
  you.
</p>
<ul class="bullet">
  <li>
    Work through the sample exam (which includes some questions from
    previous semesters) that we've posted to the schedule page.
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>
      It is representative of the <em>style</em> of the questions that
      we would ask, even if the distribution of some of the topics
      doesn't match the emphasis we've placed on them this semester.
    </li>
    <li>
      Compare your solutions against the sample solutions we've
      posted <em>after</em> you've thought through the questions.
    </li>
    <li>
      For more in-depth discussion of specific questions, watch the
      sample exam video that will be posted to the course webpage.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
    Review any slides/videos on the schedule page where the material wasn't
    clear before conference. If you still have questions, please ask
    us!
  </li>
  <li>
    Review the code that we've posted on the schedule page. It is
    often heavily commented and related to one of the recent topics.
  </li>
  <li>
    Review the labs that you've completed.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you want more practice, the textbook has questions at the end
    of each chapter. The solutions to select questions are given in
    the back of the book.
  </li>
</ul>
