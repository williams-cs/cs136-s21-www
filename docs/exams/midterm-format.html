  Format
</p>

<p class="text">
  The midterm exam will be administered as an assignment on GLOW.
  The exam will be available at the start of Lab on Thursday, March 25<sup>th</sup>,
  and you will have the entirety of your scheduled lab meeting to
  complete the exam.
</p>

<p class="text">
  As we would normally do during our scheduled lab,
  the instructors will create a private Zoom breakout room for each student.
  If you have a question, we will be able to join you in your breakout room
  to help you.
  We will start the meeting 10 minutes early so that the full
  lab period can be utilized for the exam. Please arrive a few minutes early if
  your schedule permits.
</p>

<p class="text">
  Once we have sent all students into their breakout rooms,
  you will have 1.5 hours to complete the exam.
  Here is what that means:
</p>

<ul class="bullet">
  <li>The time that you actively work on the exam should not exceed 1.5
    hours; this time limit does not include any time spent resolving
    technical difficulties. We understand that technical difficulties
    are not only possible, but with a group as large as this, it is
    not unlikely that someone will experience a technological issue that is
    outside of their control. <em>That is OK</em>. If you are disconnected or
    if you have some other issue, please do the following:
    <ul class="bullet">
      <li>
	Message us using Slack and then try to reconnect to Zoom. Upon reconnecting,
	let us know that you had an issue, and will try to figure out an
	appropriate accomodation. If you are unsuccessful reconnecting, then
      </li>
      <li>
	Roughly document the issue in a few short sentences
	(e.g., approximately when did the issue occur, what did you
	observe, what led to the issue, how did it affect your
	exam-taking, etc.). We would like to know these details so that
	we can fix the issue in the future (if possible), and also to
	ensure that we take appropriate steps to prevent you from being
	negatively affected by it. If you are unable to reconnect to Zoom,
	then when you submit the exam (or decide
	you are unable to resolve the issue on your own), email us your
	description.
      </li>
      <li>
	Once you/we are able to resolve the issue, continue taking the
	exam and resume your 1.5 hour “timer”. Do not stress out; we
	trust you to do the right thing, and that means we trust that
	you will exercise good judgment.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p class="subheading">
  Available Resources
</p>

<p class="text">
  Because we care more about problem-solving than memorization,
  we have decided to allow select materials to be used during
  your exam-taking period.
</p>
<ul class="bullet">
	<li>
		We will provide relevant interfaces and implementation details
    as part of the exam when appropriate.
	</li>
	<li>
		For any question, you are allowed to write Java code <em>from scratch</em>,
		then compile and run your code. Note: We are looking for correct reasoning
		and understanding of concepts more than perfectly syntactically correct Java.
		You do not <em>need</em> to edit/compile/run your code (and doing so may take
		time away from other exam work) but you are permitted to do so if you think it will
		help you complete the exam more effectively.
	</li>
	<li>
		You may consult the textbook, slides, and assignments that are linked
		directly from the course webpage. While we don't prohibit you from looking
    at the videos, we think it would be a very inefficient use of your exam time
    and so we advise against it!
	</li>
	<li>
		You may consult the official Oracle Javadoc webpages, and you may consult the
		Structure5 documentation.
	</li>
	<li>
		You may look at your own private CS136 lab repositories.
	</li>
</ul>
<p class="text">
	However, you <b>may not</b> use any search engines or public webpages,
	and you may not discuss any exam questions with anyone else, during or after the exam.
</p>

<p class="text">
  Although we strongly encourage you to perform calculations, draw pictures, and/or draft answers on scratch paper,
  we cannot grade this work.
  Please make sure that the answers you submit
  represent the work that you would like us to consider.
</p>

<p class="subheading">
  GLOW Idiosyncrasies
</p>


<p class="text">
	As an aside, GLOW may attempt to assign a "grade" as soon as
	you submit your exam. If this happens, ignore that grade as it
	is not a reflection of how we will be evaluating your work.
	We are intentionally not attempting to use the autograding features in GLOW
	because they are misleading; we will carefully review your exams by hand and
	provide the same individualized feedback that we would to a physical exam.
</p>
<p class="text">
  GLOW may also alert you each time an individual problem is graded. These alerts
  should also be ignored. When the exams are completely graded, we will let you
  know.
