    <p class="info">
      This lab introduces us to some of the tools, techniques, and workflows
      that we will be using throughout this course; we adapted these workflows
      from “industry best-practices”. This lab handout walks through all of the
      steps that we will take in a typical week when acquiring lab starter code,
      submitting completed lab assignments, and receiving lab feedback.

      <br><br>

      The skills developed in this lab will help us on multiple fronts. The
      tools that we explore (e.g., the Atom text editor, a command line terminal, etc.)
      and the workflow we use (checkpointing our progress using the
      <code>git</code> version control system) will help us to work efficiently,
      safely, and flexibly throughout the semester.

      <br><br>

      However, before we can begin our workflow, we need to prepare
      our computers with some important software so we can do things
      like to create, compile, and run Java programs.

      <br><br>

      <em> Note that we have biased our instructions for Unix-like operating
      systems. MacOS and Linux are two examples of Unix-like operating systems,
      and since we normally use MacOS in our CS136 computing lab, the
      instructions often use MacOS as an example. If you have a different
      operating system, like Windows, that is OK!  The steps are just slightly
      different, so read carefully.</em>

    <p class="heading" id="editor">
      Step 1: Install a Text Editor
    </p>

    <p class="text">
    During a typical semester, you would have 24-hour in-person
    access to lab machines with all software pre-installed and configured.
    However, as computer science students, we should become comfortable with
    installing software ourselves. Let’s begin making our personal computers our
    own!
  </p>

    <p class="text">There are many editors that were designed for writing code.
    These so-called “<a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_text_editors">text editors</a>”
    are very different than word processing software like Microsoft Office.
    There are very basic “terminal editors”, like <a
    href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">emacs</a> or <a
    href="https://www.vim.org/">vim</a>, that have the look and feel of the
    environments that 80’s movie hackers would work in (a small black window with even smaller green text). There are also
    sophisticated “Integrated Development Environments”, like <a
    href="https://www.eclipse.org/eclipseide/">Eclipse</a>, that automate some
    non-obvious programming tasks, but that also require extensive
    configuration. For this course, you will use <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a>,
    a text editor that falls somewhere in the middle of this taxonomy. Atom provides
    all of the features of a modern code editor, and some useful integrations
    with tools that will help us in this course. As instructors, we will be
    using Atom, and we encourage you to do the same.</p>

    <p class="text">Please download and install <a
    href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a> on your personal computing device. We
    highly recommend that you also install the <a
    href="https://atom.io/packages/teletype">teletype</a> package. Teletype will
    let us more easily "pair program". We plan to use teletype extensively in later labs;
    installing it now will help us stay ahead.</p>

	<!--
    <p class="text"><b>Note to instructors: We should add a description of enabling
      <code>teletype</code> via creating a <code>GitHub</code> account!</b>
    </p>
	-->

    <p class="heading" id="git">
      Step 2: Install Git
    </p>

    <p class="text">Developing a piece of software typically requires a number of
      rounds of entering code, testing, debugging, and rewriting, and the code changes quite
      a bit over time. Frequently, it is desireable or necessary to go back to an
      earlier version of your project code. <i>Version control systems</i> are
      pieces of software that allow programmers to maintain snapshots (copies) of
      their code at various stages of its development--this can be a life-saver!

    <p class="text">In this course we will be using the
    <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control">Git
    version control system</a>.
    Git is one of many version control systems; it is important to know <a
    href="https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/ebook/en/command-line/basics/what-is-version-control#start">what
    a version control system is</a> and <a
    href="https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/ebook/en/command-line/basics/why-use-version-control">why
    you might want to use one</a>. We encourage you to explore the links in
    this paragraph to learn more about version control.<p>

    <p class="text"><a
    href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git">Installing
    Git</a> can be straightforward, but there are a few steps to configure it to
    work exactly the way you want. Luckily, we can use Atom’s Git integration
    for most of our Git needs! To install git, follow the directions in the link
    above for your operating system.</p>

    <p class="subheading">Further Git Installation Notes for Windows Users</p>
    <p class="text">Among the <em>many</em>
    dialog boxes you will click through during this installation, you should
    accept the default suggested for all but two.
    <ul class="bullet">
      <li>The <em>git editor</em> suggestion: Do not accept <code>vim</code> (it is likely not
    installed on your machine and it is a difficult editor to learn); instead
      choose Atom.</p></li>
      <li>Open SSL vs Windos Secure Channel: Choose Windows Secure Channel.</li>
    </ul>


    <p class="heading" id="java">
      Step 3: Install Java
    </p>

    <p class="text">
  In this step,
    <a
    href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html">you
    will install Java</a> on your own computer, if you haven’t already.
    <em>(Note: There are many ways to install Java, even within the same
    operating system (macOS, Microsoft Windows, Linux, etc.), so if you know of
    another way to install Java you should feel free to try it.)</em>
    </p>

    <p class="text">
    We want to install the "Java Development Kit", or JDK. If you click on the <a
    href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/14/install/overview-jdk-installation.html">Installation
    Instructions link</a>, it will take you to a page that explains how to install
    Java on three different platforms (Windows, Linux, and macOS). The
    instructions aren't exactly concise, so you may want to jump to the <a
    href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk14-downloads.html">JDK
    Downloads page</a> and select the appropriate download for your system: "macOS
    Installer" if on macOS, or Windows x64 installer if on Windows 10. Then,
    double click the downloaded file and follow the installation instructions it
    gives (or go back to the instructions in the previous link as a reference).

    </p>

    <p class="subheading">Further Java Installation Notes for Windows Users</p>

    <p class="text">After you have installed java, you should check that the
    operating system can find it. To do so, open the <code>Git Bash</code> app
    that should have been installed as part of your git installation above. You
    can do this by typing <code>bash</code> into the search text box next to the
    Windows Start icon. Then type <code>javac --version</code>. This should give
    you some information about the version of java you have installed. If it
    does, you’re ready to move on to <a href="#repos">Step 4 below</a>!</p>

    <p class="text">If, instead, typing <code>javac --version</code> gives you
    an error message, you will need to edit one of what the operating system
    calls the <em>system environment variables</em>. The one you want to edit is
    called the <code>Path</code> variable. To do this, type <code>env</code> in
    the search text box beside the Start icon and select <code>Edit the system
    environment variables</code>. A dialog box appears. In the
    <code>Advanced</code> tab, select <code>Environment Variables...</code>.
    Another dialog box appears. Under <code>System variables</code> select the
    line that says <code>Path</code> then select <code>Edit...</code>. A dialog
    box appears. It will contain a text area with a list of directories.
    Double-click in the text area <em>below</em> the last item in the list. Here
    you will enter the location in which the java commands have been stored. It
    will have the form:</p>

    <p class="text">
      <code>C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-VERSION</code></p>

    <p class="text">where VERSION is the version number of your java installation. For example, it might be

    <p class="text"><code>C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-15.0.2</code></p>

    <p class="text">To find the version number, type <code>javac --version</code> in your terminal window.</p>


    <p class="heading" id="repos">Step 4: Get Your Repository</a>

      <p class="text">Each of us has been given our own private repository on
      the CS department GitLab infrastructure. Your repository for each lab this
      semester will be named based on a combination of the course
      (<code>cs136</code>), the semester (<code>s21</code>), your username (on the
      CS department infrastructure, e.g., <code>22abc1</code>), and the
      assignment (e.g., <code>environment</code>). For this lab, your repository
      take the form of:</p>

<p class="text"><code>https://evolene.cs.williams.edu/cs136-s21/lab00-environment/&lt;YOUR_USERNAME&gt;-lab00-environment.git</code></p>

      <p class="text">The part of the path above
      <code>&lt;YOUR_USERNAME&gt;</code> will be replaced by your username, so
      if your username was <code>22abc1</code>, your repository would be
      accessed at:</p>

<p class="text"><code>https://evolene.cs.williams.edu/cs136-s21/lab00-environment/22abc1-lab00-environment.git</code></p>

      <p class="text">We will use the git version control system to retrieve
      this repository from the CS department servers, and <em>clone</em> it to
      your local computer. This creates a local copy of your repository that has
      its own independent timeline.</p>

      <p class="text">To start, open a <i>command-line terminal</i> on your local machine.</p>
      <ul class="bullet">

        <li>On macOS, whenever we say "terminal", we mean the application
        <code>Terminal.app</code>. You can find <code>Terminal.app</code> in the
        <code>Utilities</code> folder inside the <code>Applications</code>
        directory. (Alternatively, you could use “Spotlight Search” by holding
        “⌘” and pressing the space bar. If you start typing “Terminal” in the
        Spotlight Search, you can select <code>Terminal.app</code> from a short
        list of options.) Once you’ve opened <code>Terminal.app</code>, the
        app’s icon should appear on the “Dock”; we suggest you right click the
        icon (ctrl-click if you don’t have a mouse), go to the “Options” menu
        item, and then select “Keep in Dock”, because we will be using the
        terminal repeatedly throughout the course.

        <li>On Windows, whenever we say "terminal", we mean the application
        Git Bash, which you installed in <a href="#git">Step 2</a> above. To
        open the Git Bash application, you can type "bash" into the search text
        box next to the Windows Start icon. Then you should see a terminal
        window not unlike the terminal on macOS (shown below).

        <br>
        Note: You may be familiar with other command-line terminals for Windows,
        such as <code>Command Prompt</code> and others, but use Git Bash, as it
        uses a similar command syntax as Unix-based terminals, and that is the
        syntax we will use an any descriptions of terminal interactions.
      </ul>

      <p class="text"> It isn’t a stretch to say that the terminal is among the
      most important applications for programmers, so any investment you make in
      order to familiarize your self with the terminal will surely pay off. As
      far as we are aware, the functionality of Git Bash and
      <code>Terminal.app</code> are comparable for the things we will be doing in
      this course, but be aware that there are subtle differences that may come
      in with more advanced usage.</p>

      <p class="text">At this point, you've successfully opened the terminal on
      Windows or macOS, and you should see a "prompt" where text will appear
      when you start typing. The prompt may take different formats depending on
      your settings. Ours looks like this, but don’t worry if yours looks a
      little different:</p>

      <p class="text"><img src="images/terminal.png" /></p>

      <p class="text">As a convention, we’ll use the dollar sign
      (<code>$</code>) to signify the prompt in our examples throughout this
      course. So when you see instructions like the following,</p>

      <p class="text"><code>$ ls</code></p>

      <p class="text">it means that at the prompt, you should type the command
      <code>ls</code>. When I type <code>ls</code> and press <code>Enter</code>,
      I see:</p>

      <p class="text"><code>$ ls<br>
        Desktop     Documents   Library     Music   notes.txt   Pictures<br>
      </code></p>

      <p class="text">This output means that there are files called
      <code>Desktop</code>, <code>Documents</code>, etc. in my current working
      directory. Terminal commands are often run on files in your file system,
      so when you open a terminal, by default, it assumes that you want to work
      with files in your home folder. Therefore, your default <em>current
      working directory</em> is usually your home folder. The files shown above
      are the ones in my home folder. <code>ls</code> is short for “list”, so we
      usually call its output a <em>directory listing</em>.</p> <p
      class="text">You might recognize that some of the files in the directory
      listing above are, themselves, directories. How can you tell the
      difference? Try running <code>ls</code> with some extra
      <em>arguments</em> (phonetically, you will type "ell ess minus ell"):</p>

      <p class="text"><code>$ ls -l<br>
      total 8<br>
      drwxr-xr-x  2 cs136  staff   64 Jan 25 13:11 Desktop<br>
      drwxr-xr-x  2 cs136  staff   64 Jan 25 13:11 Documents<br>
      drwxr-xr-x  2 cs136  staff   64 Jan 25 13:11 Library<br>
      drwxr-xr-x  2 cs136  staff   64 Jan 25 13:11 Music<br>
      -rw-r--r--  1 cs136  staff  235 Jan 25 13:19 notes.txt<br>
      drwxr-xr-x  2 cs136  staff   64 Jan 25 13:11 Pictures<br>
</code></p>

      <p class="text">See the cryptic text all the way to the left? It looks
      like <code>drwxr-xr-x</code>. If that text starts with a <code>d</code>,
      the entry in the listing is a <code>d</code>irectory. If it starts with a
      dash, <code>-</code>, like <code>-rw-r--r--</code>, then the entry is an
      ordinary file. So here, you can see that <code>notes.txt</code> is a
      regular file.</p>

      <p class="text">Now that we've explored our home directory and a few
      terminal commands, we would like to <em>clone</em> our repository, which creates a
	copy of our repository on our local computer. Before we use <tt>git</tt> to
	get a copy of our lab, we will do a final one-time setup for <tt>git</tt>
	(replacing the capitals with appropriate values, of course):
      </p>

  <p class="text"><code>git config --global user.name 'YOUR NAME'<br>
  git config --global user.email 'YOUR-EMAIL@williams.edu'<br>
  git config --global push.default simple<br>
  git config --global core.editor "atom --wait"<br>
</code><p>

  <p class="text">
(If you are a Windows user, you will also need to execute one more line, in addition to those above:
  <code>git config --global http.sslbackend schannel</code>)<br>

  You should only ever need to do this <tt>git</tt> setup once.
  </p>

  <p class="text">
      I like to keep all of my
      files organized by course, so I would like all of my CS136 repositories
      for my labs this semester to be kept in the same directory. I can create a
      new directory for this purpose using the <code>mkdir</code> command as
      follows:</p>

      <p class="text"><code>$ mkdir cs136</code></p>

      <p class="text">This creates a new directory called <code>cs136</code>
      inside my current working directory. If I type <code>ls -l</code>, I should
      now see <code>cs136</code> in the directory listing:</p>

      <p class="text"><code>
      $ ls -l<br>
      total 9<br>
      drwxr-xr-x  2 cs136  staff   64 Sep 04 13:11 cs136<br>
      drwxr-xr-x  2 cs136  staff   64 Jan 25 13:11 Desktop<br>
      drwxr-xr-x  2 cs136  staff   64 Jan 25 13:11 Documents<br>
      drwxr-xr-x  2 cs136  staff   64 Jan 25 13:11 Library<br>
      drwxr-xr-x  2 cs136  staff   64 Jan 25 13:11 Music<br>
      -rw-r--r--  1 cs136  staff  235 Jan 25 13:19 notes.txt<br>
      drwxr-xr-x  2 cs136  staff   64 Jan 25 13:11 Pictures<br>
      </code></p>

      <p class="text">You can now change your working directory to be
      <code>cs136</code> using the <code>cd</code> command (you guessed it,
      <code>cd</code> is short for "change directory"):</p>

      <p class="text"><code>$ cd c136</code></p>

      <p class="text">By alternately using the <code>ls</code> and
      <code>cd</code> commands, you should be able to navigate your files in
      exactly the same way that you navigate them when you are pointing and
      clicking with a mouse in your operating system's file explorer (e.g., Finder).</p>

      <p class="text">Verify that you are inside your cs136 directory using the
      <code>pwd</code> command.</p>

      <p class="text">Now that you are inside the place that you want your
      repository to live, clone it. The <code>git</code> program that you
      installed above has many options, and we will use the clone option:</p>

      <p class="text"><code>$ git clone https://evolene.cs.williams.edu/cs136-s21/lab00-environment/&lt;YOUR_USERNAME&gt;-lab00-environment.git</code></p>

      <p class="text">(replacing <code>&lt;YOUR_USERNAME&gt;</code> with your
      username, of course)</p>

      <p class="text">Now if you type <code>ls</code>, you should see a copy of
      your newly cloned repository. Change directories into your repository
      using <code>cd</code>.</p>

    <p class="heading" id="hello">
      Step 5: Hello world!
    </p>

    <p class="text">At this point, you have installed Java, a tool for writing Java programs
    (<code>Atom.app</code>), and a program for managing your coding progress
    (<code>git</code>), our next order of business is to create, compile, and run a
    simple Java program.</p>

    <p class="text">You should start by opening Atom.
    The first time you open Atom, you will see some welcome
    messages. Click the appropriate boxes to disable the welcome messages and
    (dis)agree to telemetry. You should have a (mostly) empty window. Go to the
    <code>File</code> menu and select “Add Project Folder…”. You should select
    the repository that you just cloned to be your project folder (select the
    folder itself). When you are done, you should see something like the picture below:</p>

    <p class="text"><img width=800 src="images/atom-project.png" /></p>

    <p class="text">Note the left panel now contains my project folder, and
    inside that folder is the single file <code>README.md</code>. Inside that
    file, you will see a version of what appears in your repository when viewed
    on GitLab. Try clicking it to see its contents. By default, GitLab always
    displays a repository's <code>README.md</code> file, albeit in a more nicely
    rendered format; the <code>README.md</code> is where we will often put
    useful links and descriptions for your upcoming labs. The file extension
    <code>.md</code> indicates that a file is a markdown file. You may wish to
    familiarize yourself with markdown in your copious free time, but it is not
    required.</p>

<br>

    <p class="text">Below, we have included the text for the program that you
    should create inside your repository. So create a new file (“File”→“New
    File”) called <code>HelloWorld.java</code>. You are strongly advised to
    <em>retype</em> this program into your text editor in the newly created
    file. Retyping instead of copying and pasting will encourage you to notice
    certain details that you might not ordinarily notice.</p>


    <pre><code>
          public class HelloWorld {
            public static void main(String[] args) {
              System.out.println(&quot;Hello world!&quot;);
            }
          }
  </code></pre>

<p class="text">Save this code in the file called <code>HelloWorld.java</code>. You should
see the “blue dot” on the Atom tab for <code>HelloWorld.java</code> disappear.
This means that all of your changes are saved.</p>

<p class="text">Now that you’ve created your <code>HelloWorld.java</code> program, we’ve
arrived at the fun part. We are going to <em>compile</em> our
<code>HelloWorld.java</code> program into a form that can be run by the computer
using the <code>javac</code> command. We call this step <em>compilation</em>.
From the terminal window that is “inside” your repository (i.e., the terminal’s
current working directory is inside the repository that you’ve cloned) Type:</p>

<pre><code>
          $ javac HelloWorld.java</code></pre>

<p class="text">If everything goes smoothly–if there are no errors in your program–you will
see output like this:</p>

<pre><code>
          $ javac HelloWorld.java
          $</code></pre>

<p class="text">In other words, you will see no output when things <em>go right</em>. In the
terminal, it is conventional for programs only to produce output when things
<em>go wrong</em>. No news is good news! If you get output, that’s <code>javac</code>’s way of telling
you that there was an error and that you need to fix it. <code>javac</code> goes
to great lengths to tell you what went wrong. Don’t be afraid of what
<code>javac</code> prints on your screen. Read it, because it will probably help
you find your issue!</p>

<p class="text">For example, if I see:</p>
<pre><code>
        $ javac HelloWorld.java
        HelloWorld.java:3: error: &#39;;&#39; expected
        System.out.println(&quot;Hello world!&quot;)
                                                    ^
        1 error
</code></pre>


<p class="text">then <code>javac</code> is telling me that at the location indicated with the
<code>^</code>, it was expecting a <code>;</code> character, but it did not find
one. Putting in a <code>;</code> character at that location makes my program
compile without errors.</p>

<p class="text">Once you have successfully compiled your program, you should see a new file
in your directory:</p>
<pre><code>
        $ ls -l
        total 8

<p class="text">Do you see it? It should be called <code>HelloWorld.class</code>. This is a
<em>compiled</em> Java program, which we can now run. So let’s run it.</p>

<pre><code>
        $ java HelloWorld
        Hello world!</code></pre>

<p class="text">We’ve run our first program! Note we did not type <code>java
HellWorld.class</code>, we just typed the name of the class that we created,
i.e., <code>HelloWorld</code>.</p>


    <p class="heading" id="submitting.">
      Step 6: Submitting Your First Program.
    </p>

    <p class="text">In this step, we will walk through the process of submitting your completed
    program, <code>HelloWorld.java</code>. Note that you <em>will not</em> be graded
    on the correctness of your program. The purpose of this lab is to walk through
    the end-to-end process that we will be using for labs throughout the semester.
    Hopefully, we can identify potential roadblocks now, and by resolving them this
    week, all of our time during our first "real" lab can be spent making progress on the
    actual assignment!</p>

    <p class="text">The first thing we will do is open the "Git Tab". Go to
    "Packages"→"GitHub"→"Toggle Git Tab". After selecting that option, you
    should see a new column appear at the right-hand side of Atom:</p>

    <p class="text"><img width=800 src="images/atom-gittab.png" /></p>

    <p class="text">Notice that the new files show up, in green, in the area labeled "Unstaged Changes".
      What this means is that you have made changes to these files that are not yet saved into your repository's timeline.
      You should press the button labeled "Stage All", which prepares Git to create a new "commit".
      A "commit" is an entry into your project's timeline, and it encodes the current snapshot of all of your files.
      After pressing this button, the files should move from the "Unstaged Changes Area" to the "Staged Changes Area".
    </p>

    <p class="text"> Next, click in the text area that says "Commit message",
    and type a short descriptive message for your timeline. Something like
    "completed my version of Hello World!" would accurately describe the
    contents of this commit. After crafting your message, press the button that
    says "Commit to master". Note that "master" is the name of the main
    development branch of your repository. The computer science community is
    pushing to change the default branch name of Git repositories to "main"
    instead, but the current version of GitLab has not caught up. As a
    department, we are planning to make this change in the coming weeks.</p>

    <p class="text"> The last step is to sync up your the local version of your
    repository with the version of your repository that is on GitLab. As
    instructors, we cannot see what you have saved on your computer; the only
    version of your work that we can see is what is stored on GitLab. The final
    step of "Pushing" your code is how you will submit your labs this semester.
    However, it is always good to <code>git push</code> <em>even if you are still
    working!</em> By syncing your local repository with GitLab, you ensure that
    your progress is saved. </p>

    <p class="text">
      Press the button that has an upward arrow and the word "Push #"" (where # should be the number 1).
      Pressing this button will let you push the 1 new commit that you've made to your GitLab repository.
      (You should be prompted for your GitLab username and password.)
    </p>

    <p class="text"> When you are done, navigate to your GitLab repository in
    your web browser. You should see your changes reflected in your repository
    online. My repository is shown below. Notice that the "commit message"
    appears next to the files that changed during that commit. I can see
    "completed my version of Hello World!" next to the two files I've added:
    <code>HelloWorld.java</code> and <code>HelloWorld.class</code>. Once you
    confirm that you've successfully submitted, you are done! </p>

<p class="heading" id="slack">Step 7: Install/Explore Course Communication Tools</p>

<p class="text">
  Although these tools are not necessarily part of your "computing environment", we will be relying on several technologies to help us communicate in this course:
</p>
<ul class="bullet">
  <li><a href="https://glow.williams.edu">GLOW</a>: Assignment and lecture announcements</li>
  <li><a href="https://williams.zoom.us/">Zoom</a>: All remote meetings. (Important: use your <em>Williams</em> zoom account for course-based zooming)</li>
  <li><a href="https://williams-cs136-s21.slack.com">Slack</a>: Text-based communication forum</li>
</ul>

<p class="text">
  You should already be familiar with Zoom and GLOW (since we are meeting on a Zoom call for this lab, and that Zoom call was communicated to you through the course's GLOW webpages), but Slack may be new to us. Slack is a chatting utility that can either be used through its web-based or app-based clients. Slack has many features, but we will primarily use it as a low-latency communication medium. You should all have received an invitation to the <a href="https://williams-cs136-s21.slack.com">CS136 slack "workspace"</a>. Please accept that invitation if you have not already.
</p>

<p class="text">
  Each member of the course (student, instructor, TA) has their own "channel" for sending a "direct message". Please find your Lab instructor (Bill or Sam), and send them a direct message. You may say anything you'd like, but if you don't have any pressing questions or announcements, you can simply tell us what you had for breakfast (it's the most important meal of the day after all...).
</p>

<p class="text">
  We have also configured the CS136 slack workspace so that it is integrated with Zoom. Go to any channel that you wish, and try typing <code>/zoom help</code>. It should give a nice list of options. We hope that is helpful!
