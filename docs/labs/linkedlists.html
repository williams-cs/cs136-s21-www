    <p class="heading">Lab Overview: The Genius of Dummies</p>

    <p class="info">
      The central purpose of this week's lab is to give you some
      hands-on experience writing code that manipulates a linked
      structure.
      Your task is to complete the Laboratory Assignment
      from <b>Section 9.10</b> of your text, entitled <em>Lists with Dummy
      Nodes</em> (pages 215-217).
      You will start with already working code
      (a class called <tt>LinkedList</tt> that extends the <tt>structure5</tt>
      class <tt>DoublyLinkedList</tt>).  The goal is to simplify the code by
      adding two "dummy" nodes to your <tt>LinkedList</tt> in order to
      simplify the implementations of several of the class methods.
      The Laboratory Assignment in <b>Section 9.10</b> walks you through this
      process&mdash;you will have the best experience if you follow the
      instructions in that description carefully!
    </p>

    <p class="heading">Pre-lab: Step 0</p>
    <p class="text">
      Before lab, please do the following:
      </p>
      <ul class="bullet">
	<li>
	  Watch the lab video and read through the assignment
	</li>
	<li>
	  Review any course materials on linked lists (particularly doubly linked lists) that were unclear, and bring your questions.
	</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text">
	That's it for this week!

      <b>Complete Laboratory Assignment 9.10</b>, which begins on page
      215 of

      In addition, <b>answer the five Thought Questions on page

	</li>
	<li>
	  The sample testing file, <tt>TestLinkedList.java</tt> supplemented with additional
	  tests as you feel appropriate. The sample file has some tests to get you started,

    <p class="text">
      As in all labs, you will be graded on design, documentation, style,
      and correctness.  Be sure to document your program appropriately:
      include pre/post conditions and assertions where appropriate.
      We will also be looking at how well you organize your code.
      Whenever you see yourself duplicating functionality, consider moving that
      code to a helper method. There are several opportunities in this lab to simplify
      your code by using helper methods. Think carefully!
    </p>

<p class="heading" id="checkstyle-requirements"><strong><code>checkstyle</code> requirements</strong>:</p>

<p class="text">This week, we are expanding <code>checkstyle</code> to encourage you to write modular
and reusable code. Let’s first motivate that decision, and then describe
the new <code>checkstyle</code> rule.</p>

<p class="text">As a programmer, you should never type the same code over and over again.
That would be a waste of your time.
The ability to copy/paste useful code makes this tempting,
but it is <em>still very bad practice</em>!
When you copy code, you copy errors. If you ever fix those errors, you have
to remember to fix them in every location.
This “fixing” rarely happens. Trust us. We’ve been there.</p>

<p class="text">So what should you do instead? You should write a helper method!
Whenever you find yourself writing the same code more than once
(it could be a common loop, searching a data structure, computing an equation)
you should refactor that code into a method.
Then you can call that method many times, but only ever have to fix bugs
in one place.</p>

<p class="text">Similarly, if you find yourselves writing a function that is very long,
that is problematic.
The long function can probably be broken into smaller parts that
can then be composed to solve a larger problem.
Bonus: you can now reuse those parts to solve other problems!</p>

<p class="text">Breaking long functions into byte-size chunks
also has the benefit of making your code easier to read and debug:
by isolating functionality inside independent units, you can convince yourself
that each of those units is correct in isolation,
and then you can more easily convince yourself that the larger problem
is correct.</p>

<p class="text">Since we cannot easily check for copy/pasted code,
we will use checkstyle to encourage concise methods.</p>

<p class="text">The <code>checkstyle</code> tool will report an <code>[ERROR]</code> if your program has a
method that is longer than 30 lines
(excluding whitespace and single-line comments).
This new rule is in addition to previous style requirements.</p>

<p class="text"><b>In total, checkstyle will enforce the following guidelines:</b></p>
<ul class="bullet">
  <li>All class variables that are not <code>final</code> must be declared <code>private</code> or <code>protected</code> (i.e., no <code>public</code> member variables unless they are constants).</li>
  <li>All <code>public</code> methods must include a “Javadoc” comment (starts with <code>/**</code> and ends with <code>*/</code>; it should include descriptions of the function, the arguments, and any pre/post conditions).</li>
  <li>No methods should be longer than 30˘ lines (exluding whitespace and single-line comments).</li>
</ul>
<br><br>
<p class="text"><b>To run <code>checkstyle</code>, you would type the following command at the terminal:</b></p>
<pre><code>
          $ ./checkstyle
</code></pre>

<p class="text">The <code>./</code> is peculiar to Unix: it tells the terminal to look for the
<code>checkstyle</code> program in the current directory.
This command will run <code>checkstyle</code> on every Java program in your directory.
To run <code>checkstyle</code> on a specific Java file, type:</p>
<pre><code>
          $ ./checkstyle SomeFile.java
</code></pre>

<hr class="style12" />

<p class="heading" id="javac-requirements"><strong><code>javac</code> requirements</strong>:</p>

<p class="text">In addition to <code>checkstyle</code>, we will continue to enforce
proper use of Java generics.</p>
<ul class="bullet">
  <li>Compiling your code with <code>javac</code> must not produce the following message:
    <pre><code>Note: YourProgram.java uses unchecked or unsafe operations.
Note: Recompile with -Xlint:unchecked for details.
</code></pre>
  </li>
</ul>

<p class="text">This message tells you how to get more information. Recompile your program as follows (replace with the appropriate file name):</p>
<pre><code>
          $ javac -Xlint:unchecked YourProgram.java
</code></pre>
<p class="text">The output will give you details about the issue.</p>

<p class="text">To fix this problem, make sure that you specify type parameters for every generic class, both when <em>declaring</em> the variable’s type and when <em>instantiating</em> an object.
For example, to create a <code>Vector</code> that stores <code>Integer</code> objects, one would type:</p>

<pre><code>
          Vector&lt;Integer&gt; intVec = new Vector&lt;Integer&gt;();
</code></pre>


    <p class="heading">Submitting Your Lab</p>

      <p class="text">As you complete portions of this lab, you
      should <code>commit</code> your changes and <code>push</code>
      them. <u>Commit early and often.</u> When the deadline arrives,
      we will retrieve the latest version of your code. If you are
      confident that you are done, please use the phrase <code>"Lab
      Submission"</code> as the commit message for your final
      commit. If you later decide that you have more edits to make, it
      is OK. We will look at the latest commit before the
      deadline.</p>
      <ul class="bullet">
	<li>
	  <u>Be sure to push your changes to GitLab.</u>
	</li>
	<li>
	  <u>Verify your changes on GitLab.</u>
	  Navigate in your web browser to your repository on
	  GitLab. It should be available
	  at <code>https://evolene.cs.williams.edu/cs136-f20/lab03-lists/USERNAME-lab03-lists</code>. You
	  should see all changes reflected in the files that
	  you <code>push</code>. If not, go back and make sure you
	  have both committed and pushed.
	</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="text">We will know that the files are yours because
      they are in <em>your</em> <code>git</code> repository. <u>Do not
      include identifying information in the code that you submit.</u>
      We grade your lab programs anonymously to avoid bias. In
      your <code>README.md</code> file, please cite any sources of
      inspiration or collaboration (e.g., conversations with
      classmates). We take the honor code very seriously, and so
      should you. Please include the statement <code>"I am the sole
      author of the work in this repository."</code> in the comments
      at the top your Java files.</p>

      <p class="heading" id="late">Late Days</p>
    <p class="text">Remember that if&dash;for any reason&dash;you will be submitting your lab beyond <thead>
    submission deadline, you'll need to</thead> fill out the <a
