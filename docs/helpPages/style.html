Style Guide
</p>
<div class="text">

The way you present your program is just as important as having a
correct program.  While having good comments or good variable names
will not affect the correctness of your program, it will make it
easier to read your program.  It is important that others be able to
understand your code so that they can modify your code if they have
to.  A large fraction of your lab grade will be determined by your
programming style.
<p>
This is a guide to help you better understand what we are looking for
when we look at your programs.  As the semester progresses there will
be steeper penalties for stylistic mistakes.  So, get into the habit
of writing good labs from the beginning.  Our class examples the
textbook should serve as additional examples of well-formatted and
documented code.  <b>Always look over your code and your style before
handing in your labs.</b>

<h3>Commenting</h3>
<p>Always write accurate yet concise comments:
<ul>

<li>Be specific with your comments.  What happens when the mouse
    is pressed?  What is the <tt>Vector</tt> used for?  Your
    comments should describe the intent of the code.  What are you
    trying to accomplish with this piece of code?

    <li>Do not make your comments too long.  Any line of comment or
    code that is over 80 characters will not print nicely.  If it does
    not print, the TA will not be able to read it.  Consider revising
    or writing it on multiple lines.

    <li>Do not overcomment!  Overcommenting can make the program hard
    to read just as much as under-commenting.  Do not comment every
    line.  If they are simple instructions, most people will
    understand them without comments.  If you think you need
    commenting, try commenting chunks of code under the same comment.

    <li>Delete any extraneous code that is not used.  You would not
    hand in an English paper with crossed out lines.  Similarly, you
    should not hand in a lab with commented out code.  Remove all code
    that you comment out.

</ul>
<p>You should write comments for:
<ol>

    <li><b>Class (Program)</b>: At the top of each class, you should
    write your name, date of creation, and a brief description of what
    the class is for.  If you decide to do more than the assignment
    requested, you should describe these "extra" features in the
    program under the class description.  Sometimes it's hard to tell
    a bug from a feature.

    <li><b>Methods:</b> Above each method heading there should be a
    brief description of what the method does.  You should also
    describe what each parameter means and what the return result
    means.  If the method code is simple you do not need to comment in
    the method body.  If the method body is complicated, you might
    want to add some comments to certain areas that you deem to be
    complicated.

    <li><b>Variables and constants</b>: In general, variables and
    constants should all have comments as to what they are used for.
    For example a good comment for your variable <tt>int player </tt>
    in our Nim game examples would be: <br>
    <tt>// the player whose turn it currently is</tt>.  <br>
    Occasionally several closely related variables
    or constants can be grouped together under the same comment.

</ol>

<h3>Blank Lines</h3>
Blank lines are used to delineate different areas of the code.  The
instance variable declarations at the top of your program should be
separated from the header of the class and the header of the first
method.  There should always be space between methods.  It is
advisable to break up long method bodies and long declarations into
logical pieces.  Always start a new line after the semicolon.
Always leave a blank line before a comment line.

<h3>Names</h3>

You should always choose names that suggest the meanings of the things
being named.  If the purpose of a method is to draw a rectangle, then
a good name for that method is <tt>drawRect</tt>.  If there is a
variable used to store the cards held by a player, suitable names may
be <tt>playerHand</tt> or <tt>hand</tt>.

<ul>

    <li>Names that have nothing to do with the program are bad.
    Example: <tt>FramedRect frodo</tt>.

    <li>Names that are not specific or descriptive enough are
    generally bad names.  Ex.  <tt>Card card</tt> or <tt>Card c</tt>
    are not as good as <tt>Card ace</tt> if the card represents an
    ace.

    <li>Try not to name objects sequentially.  You should only do this
    when the objects are related in some way that is not otherwise
    expressible.  Ex., <tt>card1</tt>, <tt>card2</tt>, <tt>card3</tt>
    are not as good as <tt>ace</tt>, <tt>king</tt>, and <tt>queen</tt>
    if that is what the cards are.

</ul>
<p>
Also, follow the Java capitalization convention:
<ul>
<li> constants are all capital letters,
<li> classes begin with uppercase,
<li> variable and method names begin with lowercase, while uppercase is used to start
new words in multi-word names.
</ul>

<p>
Instance variables should almost <em>never</em> be declared to be <tt>public</tt>.  Instance
variables should only be used when a value is part of the objects persistent state (e.g., it must be saved for use after
a constructor or method has been completed).  Otherwise local variables
should be used.
</p>

<h3>Format</h3>

<p>
Your program should be organized as neatly as possible.  All method
headers should be aligned with each other.  Variables should also be
aligned.  You should indent consistently.  A good heuristic is that
whenever you see an open curly brace you should indent your code 2 or
3 spaces until the ending curly brace.  See the example below.
</p>

<p>
The following is a guide to what your code should look like.  There
are variations that are acceptable, but this is a good format to
follow.
</p>

<pre><code>
/**
 * Lab:
 * Description of Class and Extras...
 */
public class ClassName {

  // comment for firstVariable
  type1 firstVariable;

  // comment for secondVariable
  type2 secondVariable;
        .
        .
        .
  /*
   * This variable needs a really long comment that doesn't fit on
   * the end of the line with the declaration
   */
  typeN nthVariable;

  /**
   * comments for method should follow "javadoc" formatting
   * when possible
   * @param  param1 is the first parameter
   */
  public void methodName1(type1 param1) {
    code line 1;
    if (condition) {
      code line 3;
      code line 4;
    }
    code line 5;
  }

  /**
   * comments for method
   *
   * @param  param1 is the first parameter
   * @param  param2 is the first parameter
   * @return a value that indicates ...
   * @pre precondition (if one exists)
   * @pre a second precondition (if one exists)
   * @post a postcondition
   */
  public int methodName2(type1 param1, type2 param2) {
    .
    .
    .
  }
}
