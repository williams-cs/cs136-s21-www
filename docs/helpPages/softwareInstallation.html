      This document will walk through all of the steps needed to
      install the Atom editor, Java Development Kit, and Git
      version control system.

      <em>
	Note that we have biased our instructions for Unix-like
	operating systems. Linux and MacOS are two examples of
	Unix-like operating systems, the type we use in our courses.
  These instructions often use MacOS
	as an example. If you have a different operating system, like
	Windows, that is OK!  The steps are just slightly different,
	so read carefully.

    <p class="heading" id="editor">
      Step 1: Install a Text Editor
    </p>

    <p class="text">This is very straightforward. Just download and install
      Atom on your personal computing device.
      Also install the <a href="https://atom.io/packages/teletype">teletype</a> package. Teletype will let us “pair program”.
</p>

    <p class="heading" id="git">
      Step 2: Install Git
    </p>

    <p class="text"><a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git">Installing Git</a> can be straightforward, but there are a few steps to configure it to work exactly the way you want. To install git, follow the directions in the link above for your operating system.</p>

    <p class="text"><em>Note for Windows users</em>: Among the <em>many</em> dialog boxes you will click through during this installation, you should accept the default suggested for all but one. That one is the <em>git editor</em> suggestion. Do not accept <code>vim</code> (it is likely not installed on your machine and it is a rather painful editor to use); instead choose Atom.</p>

    <p class="heading" id="java">
      Step 3: Install Java
    </p>

    <p class="text">There are many ways to install Java, even within the same operating system (Apple’s OSX, Microsoft Windows, Linux, etc.).
      We reccommend <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/14/install/overview-jdk-installation.html">this one</a>.
    </p>

    <p class="text"><em>Note for Windows users</em>: After you have installed java, you should check that the operating system can find it. To do so, open the <code>Git Bash</code> app that should have been installed as part of your git installation above. You can do this by typing <code>bash</code> into the search text box next to the Windows Start icon. Then type <code>javac --version</code>. This should give you some information about the version of java you have installed.
    </p>

    <p class="text">If typing <code>javac --version</code> gives you an error message, you will need to edit one of what the operating system calls the <em>system environment variables</em>. The one you want to edit is called the <code>Path</code> variable. To do this, type <code>env</code> in the search text box beside the Start icon and select <code>Edit the system environment variables</code>. A dialog box appears. In the <code>Advanced</code> tab, select <code>Environment Variables...</code>. Another dialog box appears. Under <code>System variables</code> select the line that says <code>Path</code> then select <code>Edit...</code>. A dialog box appears. It will contain a text area with a list of directories. Double-click in the text area <em>below</em> the last item in the list. Here you will enter the location in which the java commands have been stored. It will have the form:</p>

    <pre><code>
        C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-VERSION
    </code></pre>

    <p class="text">where VERSION is the version number of your java installation. For example, it might be</p>

    <pre><code>
        C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-15.0.2
    </code></pre>

    <p class="text">To find the version number, type <code>javac --version</code> in your terminal window.</p>

    <p> That's it!</p>
