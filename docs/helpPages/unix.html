Mac and Unix Hints
</p>



<div class="text">

<p>
This set of notes assumes that you have never used Unix before. It
does assume, however, that you are comfortable using computers with a
graphical user interface, such as the Macintosh operating system or
Microsoft Windows.  You should sit down at a Mac in the lab and go
through this tutorial trying things out as they are explained. Upon
completion, you should be able to understand the basics of entering
commands, move around in the file system
and view existing files, and know where to find <a href="#Getting help">help</a>.

To gain experience with these topics, try things out as you read.

<h3><a NAME="Logging in"></a>Logging In</h3>

To start, you must log in to one of the Macintosh computers in our
lab.  Begin by entering the user name and password for your computer
science account in the login window and click ``Log in''.  Your user
name for this account may be different than the one used for computer
accounts provided by the Office of Information Technology (typically
something like ewr1), and the initial password will also be different.
You must obtain this password from your instructor.  Once you log in,
the screen should display a window containing icons for some of the
files you can access on the machine.

<h3><a NAME="Password"></a>Changing Your Password</h3>


Before proceeding, you should change the password we assigned to your
account to something that only you will know and that will be easier
for you to remember.  Don't, of course, make your new password too
easy to guess.  In particular, at least use something that is a mix of
letters and numbers.  If you forget your password, the system
administrator can give you a new password.


To change your password you should:
<ul>
<li> Point the mouse at the black Apple icon in the upper left corner
of the screen.  Depress and hold down the mouse button to open a menu.
<li> Select "System Preferences" from this menu.

<li> Click once on the "Accounts" icon in the window that appears.

<li> Change your password in this window.

<li> Close the window by clicking in the red circle in the top left corner.

</ul>

Now, log out and log in again with your new password.  To log out
select the last item in the menu that appears when you depress the
mouse on the little apple image that appears in the upper left corner
of your screen.  Then click the "Log out" button that appears in the
dialog box.

The files you create for our course laboratory projects will not
actually be stored in the computer on which you are working.  Instead,
they will be stored on our department's Macintosh file server,
cortland.  By entering the account information for your account, you
have instructed the computer you are using to access your files on
cortland.  You can access your files on cortland from any computer in
our lab by simply logging in to that computer.


<h3><a NAME="Mac"></a>Using the Mac Interface</h3>

Some of you may be new to Macintoshes, and this section highlights
the most important elements of the interface.  The files on the hard drive
can be viewed by clicking on the "Mac HD" icon in the top
right-hand corner of the screen.  To go to your home directory, click on the
house icon under "Places" in the Finder window.

<p>All Mac Windows roughly look like the following window:
<p><img SRC="window.jpg">

<p>Here are some basic window management operations:
<ul>
<li>To change the size of the window, click the
mouse in the lower, right corner and drag the mouse with the button
held down.
<li>To close a window, click on the red circle in the title bar.
<li>To iconify a window (minimize), click on the yellow circle in the title
bar. The window should appear as an icon at the bottom of the display
in the tool bar.  Clicking on the icon in the tool bar will restore the window.
<li>To maximize the size of a window, click on the green circle in the title bar.  Clicking again will restore a window to its previous size.
</ul>

<p> You can start to get the feel for the environment by clicking on
the Safari icon to start a web browser.  (You are welcome to use Firefox if you are more comfortable with it.)  The safari icon is in the tool bar and looks like the following:
<p><img SRC="safari.jpg"> <p>

Go to the class web page at
<tt>http://www.cs.williams.edu/~cs136</tt> and find the
electronic version of this page.  Bookmark this page--you will be
referring to it often during lab.

<h3><a NAME="Mac"></a>Using Unix Commands</h3>

 In order to use the Unix interface on the Macintosh, you must first
 start the Terminal Program, which you can do by clicking on the
 following icon in the tool bar:
<p><img SRC="terminal.jpg"> <p>

The Terminal Program will open a shell window in which will type Unix commands.
For example, type the command "ls" in the shell window and press return.
This command will list the files in your directory.  A command consists of
the name of a program, zero or more options preceded by '-', and zero or more arguments,
which are themselves words. The command line is terminated with a carriage
return.
<p>If you make mistakes in typing on the command line, use the Delete or
Backspace key to erase the previous character.

<p>Here are other useful commands related to files:<br><br>
<table BORDER >
<tr>
<td WIDTH="110">ls</td>

<td WIDTH="267">List the files in the current directory</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td WIDTH="110">cp file1 file2</td>

<td WIDTH="267">Copy the file named file1 to a new file named file2</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td WIDTH="110">mv file1 file2</td>

<td WIDTH="267">Rename the file named file1 to have the name file2. (mv
is actually short for move, but it doesn't necessarily move anything!)</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td WIDTH="110">rm file1</td>

<td WIDTH="267">Remove the file named file1</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td WIDTH="110">more file1</td>

<td WIDTH="267">Display the contents of a file</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td WIDTH="110">lpr file1</td>

<td WIDTH="267">Print the file named file1</td>
</tr>
</table>
<br><br>
One thing you will notice with Unix is that "no news is good news". Often
if a Unix command is successful, it will produce no output! If it fails,
you will receive an error message. Of the list of commands above, only
ls and more produce output when they succeed.

<p>The "more" command deserves some more explanation because it is an interactive
command. It displays your file one "screenful" at a time.
You can try out "more" by typing

<small><pre>
more /opt/mac-cs-local/share/cs136/examples/alice.txt
</pre></small>

After each screenful,
it displays a prompt either consisting of the name of the file being displayed
(for the first screenful), END (for
the last screenful), or : (for all other screenfuls). The prompt appears
at the bottom of the terminal screen. At this prompt, you have several options,
the most useful being:
<br><br>
<table BORDER >
<tr>
<td WIDTH="103">space</td>

<td>Display the next screenful</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td WIDTH="103">b</td>

<td>Display the previous screenful</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td WIDTH="103">q</td>

<td>Quit more, returning to a shell prompt.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<br><br>

This will show you a file containing the first chapter of Alice in
Wonderland. (One useful tidbit: hitting the tab key will autocomplete
directory and file names.  Try typing "/usr/mac" and then hitting
the tab key.  It should autocomplete /usr/mac-cs-local for you.)

<p>
When you use
ls to list your file<font color="#000000">s, a directory will appear with
/ at the end of its name. </font>At all times you have a current directory.
Your commands are interpreted with respect to your current directory by
default. So, for example, ls lists the files in your current directory
if you give it no arguments. Here are some useful commands to manipulate
directories:
<br><br>

<table BORDER >
<tr>
<td WIDTH="104">mkdir dir1</td>

<td>Create a new directory named dir1.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td WIDTH="104">rmdir dir1</td>

<td>Remove the directory named dir1. You can only do this if the directory
is empty.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td WIDTH="104">cd dir1</td>

<td>Make dir1 be the current directory</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td WIDTH="104">pwd</td>

<td>Display the name of the current working directory</td>
</tr>
</table>
<br><br>

Filenames should consist only of letters, numbers, and some punctuation marks. A filename is
typically divided into a descriptive name and an extension, separated by
a period. Extensions are purely by convention but typically indicate the type
of file. For example, "myfile.txt" would be a text file, while "myfile.java"
would contain a Java program. Extensions are generally optional although some
programs, such as the Java compiler, expect them to be there.
<p>Filenames can be given as names that are relative to the current working
directory or as absolute names from the special root directory. Thus far,
we have assumed relative names that refer simply to files in the current
directory. We can also use relative names to identify files in subdirectories.
For example, "mydir/myfile" is the file named "myfile" in the directory
named "mydir", where "mydir" is located in the current working directory.

<p>Each user also has a home directory. This is the directory that is
the current directory when you start a new shell window.  (You have
already found your home directory through the standard Mac interface).
No matter what the absolute pathname is to your home directory, you
can always refer to it with the special relative pathname '~'. For
example, no matter what your current directory is, if you type "ls ~",
you will see a listing of the files in your home directory.
<p>An absolute pathname always begins with / while a relative pathname
never does. To find out the pathname that corresponds to your current
directory, type <tt>pwd</tt>. Use <tt>pwd</tt> to find the absolute
path for your home directory.

<p>One last useful feature of the command line: Pressing the up arrow
will give the last command you executed.  Pressing return will run
that command again.  Try this.  You can access older commands in your
history by hitting the up arrow multiple times.

To practice these commands, copy the <tt>alice.txt</tt> file to your
home directory with the command

<small><pre>
cp /usr/mac-cs-local/share/cs136/examples/alice.txt ~/alice.txt
</pre></small>

Rename the file, move it into a newly created
subdirectory, and practice the other basic Unix commands as well.

<h3>
<a NAME="More Windows"></a>Additional Shell Windows</h3>
You can create additional shell windows to work in more than one directory or on different tasks at the same time.
When any terminal window has the focus (by clicking in it), the menus
across the top of the screen should be "Terminal", "Shell", and so
on.  Select "New Window" or "New Tab" from the "Shell" menu.  This will create a
second terminal window or tab in your current window which you can use just as the one already open.

<p>
To close a terminal window, click on the red circle in the title bar.  To close only a single tab, click on the gray X in the right corner of the tab's title bar.
<!--
<h3>
<a NAME="Basic Emacs"></a>Basic Emacs</h3>

<p>
Emacs is a widely used text editor for Unix. To start Emacs, perform the following steps:
<ul>
  <li> Open a terminal window.
<!--  <li> Type the following command:
<pre>
   source /usr/mac-cs-local/bin/136
</pre>
(This will set up your terminal window for using xemacs and java.)-->
<!--
  <li> Type "emacs &amp;" in your shell window.
</ul>
A new window similar to that shown below should appear:
<p><img SRC="emacs.jpg">

<p>Emacs relies heavily upon
control-characters as a means of entering editing commands. Many
commands are also available via pulldown menus, but experienced users
tend to use control commands almost exclusively.
Over the semester, your repertoire of commands will grow and
will move away from menus and toward keyboard commands. For now, let's
create a new file. To do this, type Control-x followed by Control-f.
(That is, hold down the control key and press x and then f.)  At the
bottom of the window, you will see "Find file: ~/" with a small black
box following it. The box indicates where characters will go when you
type. Type in the name of the file that you want to create and hit
carriage return.  (Alternatively, you can create a new file by selecting
"Visit New File" from the "File" menu.

<p>The last line of the Emacs window is where command prompts and
messages appear. The embossed line immediately preceding it is a
status line.  It shows you the name of the file you are
editing. Before that you should see <tt>-u:--</tt>. This means that
the file is up-to-date. If it says, <tt>-u:**</tt>, it means the
buffer has been changed since it was last saved. If it
says <tt>-u:%%</tt>, it means that you cannot modify the file. After
the filename is the current line number (L1 indicates the first line)
and an indication of how far the current line is in the file in terms
of percentage. "All" indicates that the entire file is showing. "Top"
indicates that you are on the first screenful. "Bot" indicates that
you are on the last (or bottom) screenful.  The final entry is the "mode" that
you are editing in. This should say "(Java/l Abbrev)" when
editing a Java file.

<p>The area between the menu titles and the status line is the buffer
that displays the contents of the file. Most of your typing goes
directly into this buffer. Type some text. Notice the status line
changes. You can move the cursor around using the arrow keys. Use the
scrollbar to move through the file. Use the "Save" command from
the File menu to save the buffer to a file. Use "Exit Emacs" from the
File menu to exit Emacs. Notice the characters that appear in
parentheses at the ends of command names in the menus. These tell you
the keyboard characters to type to execute the commands without using
the commands. For example, saving the buffer can be executed by typing
Control-x Control-s. In the menu control characters appear as C-. Type
these by holding the control key down at the same time as typing the
second character. Another common way to enter commands is using the
Escape key. This is abbreviated M-. In this case the escape key and
the following key are typed separately. For example M-x represents
typing the Escape key followed by the "x" key.  You can also press the
"Apple" key and "x" at the same time to achieve the same effect.  Here
are the keyboard sequences for the most common Emacs commands:

<br><br>
 <table BORDER >

<tr>
<td WIDTH="86">C-v</td>

<td>Next screenful</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td WIDTH="86">M-v</td>

<td>Previous screenful</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td WIDTH="86">C-d</td>

<td>Delete next character</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td WIDTH="86">Backspace</td>

<td>Delete previous character</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td WIDTH="86">C-x C-s</td>

<td>Save buffer to a file</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td WIDTH="86">C-x C-f</td>

<td>Open a file</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td WIDTH="86">C-x C-c</td>

<td>Exit Emacs</td>
</tr>
</table>
<br><br>

<p>
You can find more Emacs commands in the <a href= "emacs.html">Emacs Hints Page</a>.
<p>
Using keyboard commands is generally faster than moving one's hands back
and forth between the mouse and keyboard as one must do to use the menus
and scrollbar. While it takes extra effort to learn, the payoff is worth
it in the long run in terms of speed of using the editor.

<h3>
<a NAME="Java"></a>Using Java</h3>
To execute a Java program, you perform two steps.  First, you compile the Java source file.  For example, to compile the file "<tt>Hello.java</tt>", type<p>
<tt>
javac Hello.java
</tt><p>
Assuming the program is free of compilation errors, a class file "<tt>Hello.class</tt>" will be created.  This files contains the compiled representation of the program.  To execute the program, you run the Java virtual machine with the command<p>
<tt>java Hello</tt><p>
The command line argument to <tt>java</tt> is the name of the class whose <tt>main</tt> method you would like to run.
Copy the file

<pre>
/usr/mac-cs-local/share/cs136/examples/Hello.java
</pre>

to your home directory, compile it, and run it.

<h3>
<a NAME="Getting help"></a>Getting Help</h3> The Unix command
<tt>man</tt> provides information about all Unix commands and
programs.  For example, to learn about the <tt>ls</tt> command, type
<tt>man ls</tt>.  You can then page through the manual information as
you did with more. To learn more about the manual, you can read the
manual about the manual by entering <tt>man man</tt> at the command
prompt.

<h3>
<a NAME="LoggingOut"></a>Logging Out</h3>

As mentioned earlier, to logout you select "Log Out..." from the Apple
menu in the top left-hand corner of the screen.  Always close all
Emacs and shell windows prior to logging out to prevent you from
losing any work.
